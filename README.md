# Grade Score Calculator 

A simple JavaScript program that calculates the total and average of multiple grade scores and determines whether the student has passed or failed based on the average score.

This mini project was built to practice JavaScript fundamentals such as arrays, loops, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.

##  Project Overview

The Grade Score Calculator takes an array of numerical scores, calculates the total and average score, and then evaluates performance using conditional logic. Based on the average score, the program outputs performance feedback and pass/fail status in the console.

---

##  Features

The program can:
- Store multiple grade scores in an array
- Calculate the total score using a loop
- Calculate the average score
- Display performance feedback based on the average score
- Determine whether the student has passed or failed

---

##  How It Works

- Grade scores are stored in an array
- A `for` loop adds all scores to calculate the total
- The average score is calculated by dividing the total by the number of scores
- Conditional statements (`if / else if / else`) are used to evaluate performance
- A pass or fail message is displayed based on the average score

---

##  Grading Logic

The program evaluates performance as follows:
- **90 and above** → Excellent
- **80–89** → Great work
- **70–79** → Well done
- **60–69** → Needs improvement
- **Below 70** → Fail

A student passes if the average score is **70 or higher**.

##  Technologies Used
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

##  Learning Goals

This project was created to practice:
- Arrays
- For loops
- Conditional logic
- Calculations and averages
- Console output
- Writing clean and readable JavaScript code

---

##  Future Improvements

Possible enhancements include:
- Allowing user input for scores
- Assigning letter grades (A, B, C, D, F)
- Displaying highest and lowest scores
- Supporting weighted averages
- Converting the logic into reusable functions
- Connecting the program to a simple HTML interface
