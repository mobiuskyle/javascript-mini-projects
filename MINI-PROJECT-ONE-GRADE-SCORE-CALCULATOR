//mini project one grade score calculator

//Mini Project 1: Grade Calculator
//Goal: Build a program that calculates a student's final grade and determines if they passed.
//Requirements:

//Create an array of at least 5 test scores (e.g., [85, 92, 78, 90, 88])
//Calculate the average score using a loop
//Use conditions to assign a letter grade:

//A: 90-100
//B: 80-89
//C: 70-79
//D: 60-69
//F: Below 60


//Log the average, letter grade, and whether the student passed (passing is C or above)

//Bonus Challenge:

//Ask the user to input scores (if you know how to use prompt() in browser)
//Find the highest and lowest scores
//Remove the lowest score before calculating the average
//if i let the user prompt

 const gradeScores = [85 , 67 , 90 , 56 ,45 ,34 ,78 ,90 ,65 ] ;
 let total = 0 ;

for(let i = 0 ; i<gradeScores.length; i++)
{total+=gradeScores[i]}
{console.log("your grade score is " , total)}

let average = total/gradeScores.length ;
console.log('you average score is ' , average);

if(average >= 90)
{ console.log('excellent keep up the good work' );
}
else if(average >= 80)
  {
    console.log('great work done,keep up the good work');
  }
else if(average >=70)
  {
    console.log('well done keep up the good work');
  }
else if(average >=60)
  {
    console.log('keep working hard but still try a little bit earlier');
  } 

if(average>=70)
{console.log('YOU HAVE PASSED') ;}
else
  {console.log('SORRY BUT YOU HAVE FAILED')}
